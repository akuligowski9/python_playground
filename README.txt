Project title: python_playground


Motivation: This space is dedicated to documenting my journey to learning Python!
From random projects to investigation of python source code, this space is dedicated to keeping track of what I've looked at related to the Python programming language. This space is also a way to get more comfortable with my terminal and building my own project outside of my day job.

Tech/framework used:
- Python 3.7

Features:
*more coming soon*
